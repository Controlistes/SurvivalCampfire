# Survival Campfire

With this **Fabric** mod you'll need to feed your fire if you want it to keep burning.

Meant to be used with mods such as [Healing Campfire](https://modrinth.com/mod/healing-campfire/version/1.19.2-4.0-fabric) and [No Hostiles Around Campfire](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-hostiles-around-campfire).

This mod requires :

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin/version/1.8.1%2Bkotlin.1.7.0)

This is my first mod. There are probably bugs. But I have tested it and it should be fine.

Special thanks to the **Fabric Discord Server**, especially @LlamaLad7 and @justanothercorpusguy, for helping me. Thanks to [Serilium](https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum) for prompting the making of this mod. Thanks to **thecech12**, the maker of the Forge mod [Unlit Campfire](https://github.com/cech12/UnlitCampfire) on which this mod is loosely based.
