# Survival Campfire

With this **Fabric** mod you'll need to feed your campfire if you want it to keep burning. 

Here is a small bushcraft introduction for beginners :
- Build a campfire as usual
- Put some fuel in the campfire. Any kind of fuel that can be used in a furnace can be used to maintain your campfire. 
- Ignite it with a flint & steel
- Add fuel at your heart's content to keep the darkness away
- Contemplate life with your friends as you bathe in the sweet warmth of a welcoming hearth

The campfire's light level and model changes depending on the amount of fuel left, so you get some visual feedback. Resource packs that change the model of the campfire are probably not compatible, but textures should work fine. This mod does not affect soul campfires.

You can configure the max amount of fuel that can be stored in a campfire and the factor by which vanilla fuel furnace values are multiplied when applied to a campfire. Config is available in-game through [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) and [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).  

Meant to be used with mods such as [Healing Campfire](https://modrinth.com/mod/healing-campfire/version/1.19.2-4.0-fabric) and [No Hostiles Around Campfire](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-hostiles-around-campfire).

This mod requires :

- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin/version/1.8.1%2Bkotlin.1.7.0)

This is my first mod. This mod is the product of a 3 days long obsession with absolutely no experience with Java and Minecraft modding beforehand. There are probably bugs. But I'm using it in my own worlds for what it's worth. This mod will never be ported to Forge as alternatives already exist.

Special thanks to the **Fabric Discord Server**, especially @LlamaLad7 and @justanothercorpusguy, for helping me. Thanks to [Serilium](https://modrinth.com/user/Serilum) for involuntary prompting the making of this mod. Thanks to **thecech12**, the maker of the Forge mod [Unlit Campfire](https://github.com/cech12/UnlitCampfire) on which this mod is loosely based.

Have fun and be excellent to each other.
